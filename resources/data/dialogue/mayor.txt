On behalf of the great town of Peabody, welcome!
Allow me to introduce myself: I am the mayor of this town.
1)Thank you mister mayor.
2)Thanks, gotta run!
3)Once I am mayor, there will be some changes around here.

1>If you have any questions, my office is off the left side of the screen.
2)Thank you for your time, Mr. Mayor.

3>My dear [[man|woman]], you haven't the slightest clue of what you're walking into!
Might I remind you, as Mayor of this town, I can easily have you buried in a shallow grave!
And you call yourself a yogurt commercial actor!
If you decide to change your ways, my office is off the left side of the screen.
