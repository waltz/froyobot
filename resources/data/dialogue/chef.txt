0>Come on in, buddy, grab a seat.
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen.
1)We're in hell?
2)What's on the menu?

1>Sure, buddy, sure.
You're in hell. That's right. Yep.
3)It's just that, I thought it would be, kind of, harder to get to?

2>Demons love the Chef's Special, Hell Medley!
It's a stew of shredded documents, amphetamines, and crude oil!
8)That's probably not safe for human consumption?
9)I'll help myself, thanks. 

3>Harder to get to?
4)Like, I just had to go down a ladder in the sewer. How does that work?
5)I'm not even dead. Isn't this an afterlife kind of place?

4>Huh!!! You mean you came down from the sewer access? Gross!!
Well if you're looking for Hell proper, it's way over to the left there, over the crevice.
6)How do I get over there?
7)If this is Hell, does that mean The Devil is here somewhere, too?

5>What are you, the Riddler?
I don't know how any of this works! I'm just the Chef!
If you're looking for Hell proper, it's way over to the left there, past the crevice.
6)How do I get over there?
7)If this is Hell, does that mean The Devil is here somewhere, too?

6>You want the main entrance, not this back alley.
You'll have to go out and come back in the front gate.
7)If this is Hell, does that mean The Devil is here somewhere, too?
2)While I'm here, what's on the menu?

7>Oh, you mean the Big Guy? Yeah he's down in lower hell. We are in a small corner of upper hell.
His throne or whatever is down there, somewhere. I guess.
6)How would I get down there?
2)So, what's on the menu?

8>Well demons love it!!! It rules!!!!!!
6)Listen, I want to get across this crevice.
7)If this is Hell, does that mean The Devil is here somewhere, too?

9>END
