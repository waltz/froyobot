The revelation of the three secrets will unveil the true meaning of the visitation and of the yogurt commercials.
Now, where did we leave off?
1)You again?
1)Am I dreaming?

1>What would you do if I made you CEO of Bob Yogurt, instead of a mere yogurt commercial actor? What would you do with that?
2)I don't think I ever wanted to be CEO of this yogurt company...
3)I would try to run the company as best I could, for the benefit of the shareholders.
4)Buddy, the name of the game is Yogurt Commercial, not Yogurt CEO.

2>You stand at the rim of a yawning chasm. Wheels are in motion around you, but you see them not.
The devil might find use for you yet.
5)You can't frighten me with this metaphysical hogwash!
5)Watch out for my soul, got it.
5)I can think for myself, thanks.

3>If you can't exert your will on the yogurt business, it will exert its will on you.
The current CEO is attempting to escape with the remains of his soul.
You walk on a tightrope above a firey pit.
5)You can't frighten me with this metaphysical hogwash!
5)Watch out for my soul, got it.
5)I can think for myself, thanks.

4>Being a CEO is also a kind of game. 
5)Let's get to the point, please.

5>Ha ha ha ha ha!
Are you ready for the second secret?
6)Hit me.

7>Good! Now you know what is at stake!
That is all for now. You must now depart from non-ordinary reality.
