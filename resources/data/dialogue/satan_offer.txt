0>Ha ha ha! Wow! 
We just saved the company by creating the Ultimate Yogurt Commercial of All Time!
What a thrill!
1)So, uh, I was just gonna get going...
1)At last, the production is a wrap.

1>You know, speaking of the company, there's still that little issue with the CEO...
He disappeared with all the money! Now there's a power vacuum at the highest level!
2)Sounds like tough luck. Could you point me to the exit?
2)What do you want me to do about it?

2>They could really use someone smart like you...
Say, how would you like to be CEO of Bob Yogurt?
3)I'd much rather you tell me how to get out of here.
4)Me, a CEO? Tell me more.

3>Are you really that ungrateful? Or are you just dense?
I'm offering you power and riches beyond anything you've known...
Ah, well. You'll come around, I suppose. Let me know if you change your mind.
END

4>I will return you to your life on the surface. 
You will take on the role of CEO of Bob Yogurt.
You can continue to play the game.
How's that sound? Pretty sweet deal, huh?
5)Let's do it!
6)What's the catch?

5>Marvelous! You won't regret it!
SATANCALLBACK
I think this will be the start of a wonderful work relationship!
We're going to become fast pals, you and I!
I will now send you back to your apartment. You're gonna be great!
END

6>No catch! Isn't that great?
I'll make you the CEO of the company. Then you just look after the business.
Honestly, it's not that hard. You'll do great.
5)Okay, I'm in.
3)Sounds too good to be true. I don't think I'll take your offer.
