2)I don't need to play your games, Quizbook McGee!
4)Let's see where this goes.

4>POLESTARCALLBACK
First, a question about how you live your life.
Would you say you "cut a fiery swath through the landscape of life's opportunities"?
Or did you course and flow like a river?
5)The fiery swath one sounds like me.
6)The water one, definitely.
7)Not sure, to be honest.

5>I see.
Next, about your character.
Are you a human being, and not a cabbage or something?
8)Yes.
9)No.

6>Mmmm, interesting.

Are you a human being, and not a cabbage or something?

11)No.

9>Good for you. Do you wish to better yourself?
10)Yes.

15)What's wrong with $name?

15>Your cosmic name shall be...
TEXTSIZE:LARGE
GONGSOUND
$cosmicName !!!
16)Yikes!
16)Whoah!
16)I accept it with pride.

16>I have one more gift for you, $cosmicName.
I bestow on you the gift of teleportation!
You will be able to teleport to any location you've visited so far.
But you can only use this power once per day.
18)How does it work?
17)Well, that's neat. Thanks, I guess.
17)I'll believe it when I see it.

17>Go in peace now, $cosmicName.

18>Think of your apartment.
It is now in your head, no?
Now simply walk from your head into your apartment.
