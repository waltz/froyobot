0>Incredible! The cosmic dagger of Hermes!
It truly is glorious, is it not!?
1)I had to stab a ghost to get it.
1)I feel its cosmic energy coursing through my body.


1>I think you should keep it, then.
Now I feel I can tell you the truth about the Astral Gate.
2)I'm not joining any cults today, thank you.
2)Is that the new hot yoga club over in the Noodle Hut shopping center?

2>The remains of the Astral Gate are up on the roof, just up this ladder.
The Gate was shut many thousands of years ago and can only be opened with the power of the lost book, the Necronomicon.
After centuries of searching, I have discovered the location of the Necronomicon!
It is in the collection of your friend, the Mayor of Peabody! He keeps it under lock and key.
And that is the truth about the Astral Gate.
3)So, do you want me to go get this book from the mayor?
4)Good talk. 

3>Ha ha ha ha!
You could never handle its great and terrible power!
No, it's best if you just forget about this business. It is unwise to meddle in ancient sealed powers.
4)Thanks for the story.

4>END
