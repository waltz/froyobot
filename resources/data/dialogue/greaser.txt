0>Heh! Step aside, daddy-o!
The Scorpion Gang is here... here to stay!
1)I don't want any trouble.
2)The scorpion gang?
5)Perfect timing. I've been looking to rough up some goons.

1>Whoah! Not so fast!
You seem like a cool cat, so I'm gonna let it slide... For now.
4)Where did you guys come from?
3)Goodbye

2>That's right, the Scorpion Gang!
This new turf of ours is looking mighty fine! Mighty fine!
4)Where did you guys come from?
3)Goodbye

3>Be cool, man. 
END

4>The open road, man, the asphalt ribbon of adventure!
We drive hard, and fast, through the night, burning gasoline and cigarettes!
We will stop at nothing until we understand the abstract notion of America in its fullness!
5)I've got all the adventure you can handle right here in my two fists.
3)I've always wanted to do something like that, but I am cowardly.

5>Now I know that only a screwball would think about messin' with the Scorpion gang.
But if you think you can handle a scrap, take a swing at my boys here!
You wouldn't be the first fool we've had to dump off a bridge!
3)We'll see.
2)Did you say the Scorpion gang?
