0>Who dares intrude on the sanctum of Sanguinus Rex Maximus?!?
Marshal your words carefully, mortal!
1)Sanguinus Rex Maximus? I'm a big fan!
2)Sanguinus. I have come to do battle.
5)Wait! I just wanted to ask you something!

1>You face a simple choice:
We can do battle, and you will surely die;
Or I will cast you into my oubliette to rot a coward's death.
2)A battle to the death it is, then.
3)That cowardly dungeon thing actually sounds better.
4)What's an oubliette?

2>VAMPIREATTACK
You simple fool! You think you can break my defensive enchantment? I am as a ghost!
Only the ancient race of moon warriors was ever so bold...
Prepare to meet your pitiful fate, mortal!

3>VAMPIRETRAP
Pleasant stay! Mwa ha ha ha ha!
END

4>VAMPIRETRAP
I guess you're about to find out! Mwa ha ha ha ha!
END

5>You tread on thin ice. Speak!
6)How did you become a vampire?
7)Are there others out there like you?
8)Is this house on the Peabody register of historic places?

6>It was three thousand years ago.... I went to my vampire mentor, Lord Agenor Stygius Grimdark!
I called on him for the feast of Saturnalia!
I killed him, by God's grace, and ate his heart!
And now I shall eat yours!
VAMPIREATTACK

7>You tread in my presence to ask such a foolish question?
There are other undead, but none as powerful as me!
Steel yourself, fool, for my attack!
VAMPIREATTACK

8>Yes!
Now go! And tell the Mayor I have not made any alterations to the property!
