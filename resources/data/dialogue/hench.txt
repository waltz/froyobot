0>Sir! Sir!
What are you doing down here in the dungeon, sir?
Did you accidentally fall in?
1)Get away from me! I don't "accidentally" do anything!
1)Shut up! I want to fall down this pit!
1)Go away!

1>Don't worry Sir, we'll get you out of the magic trap in just a second!
I know this must be embarassing for you!
Just sit tight while we work on the problem!
2)I am ordering you to let me fall into the pit!
2)I do not require your help! 
2)This is not helping!

2>Oops, there we go!
You're all set, Sir!
See you topside! Ha ha!
END
