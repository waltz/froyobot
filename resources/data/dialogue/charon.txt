0>Hello, $eitherName! Are you ready to take the final voyage?
1)I'm not ready!
2)What's all this, then?
4)Let's do it.

1>Very well. Have your fun. You'll be back! You'll see!
END

2>This is the river Styx.
In order to cross it, you must die.
Are you ready?
1)Not ready! Not ready!
3)What about being undead?
4)Sure, why not.

3>Nope, won't work.
No undead allowed.
If you want to cross this river, you'll definitely die, no shortcuts.
4)Okay then, let's do it.
1)Some other time then, maybe.

4>Alright, here we go!
Relax, would you? What, you think you're the first person to ever die or something? Good grief!
