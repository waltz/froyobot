0>Yikes! You scared me!
1)Tell me more.

1>Well, what is there to tell? I worked my way up from the bottom.
This, all this, I built myself!
Hard work and determination, my [[boy|dear girl]]! True grit.
That's what you need to succeed in this life!
Grab onto what you can and claw your way to the top! Look for any opportunity no matter how sneaky!
Focus your will on your singular purpose and to hell with everything else!
2)You had no outside help at all?

2>Well of course, "no man is an island," as Horatio Alger wrote! And it is true!
But nothing can replace hard work and a can-do attitude!
In truth, my dear [[boy|girl]], I made a deal with a very powerful benefactor.
Power talks, my [[boy|girl]]. 
3)Who is this "benefactor"?

3>I've said too much already... Real power doesn't like to be talked about much.
The real powers in this world prefer to stay behind the scenes, as it were.
Favors for favors my [[boy|girl]], favors for favors.
And now if you'll excuse me, I must get back to what I was doing...
