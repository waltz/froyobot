0>Welcome traveler! Well met! You must have journeyed long to reach this place.
1)Who are you?

1>I am Orobas. Welcome to my office.
I'm a bit of an amateur historian. Feel free to look around.
2)Thanks, I will.
3)What are you studying?

2>END

3>I collect artifacts from the forgotten civilizations. Have you heard of the transplutonian empire?
Very few artifacts from that period remain. I've gathered what records I can here, in Hell.
4)What was the transplutonian empire?
5)What artifacts do you have here?

4>Remnants of this era are so scarce and forgotten that today among your people it is nothing more than myth.
From what we've been able to learn, an ancient race of giants formed a planet-spanning civilization thousands of years before recorded history.
Ruins of their outposts can still be found on Venus, the moon, and other planets.
5)What artifacts do you have here?
6)Are you talking about Atlantis?
7)How did this empire end?

5>It looks small, but this collection is probably the largest of its kind.
I have here many ancient writing fragments that preserve some legends of the transplutonian empire.
Some, like the book of Eibon, may be traced directly to this ancient civilization.
4)What was the transplutonian empire?
8)What is the book of Eibon? 

6>The Atlantis myth is one ancient trace of them, yes. But mostly wrong in the details.
5)What artifacts do you have here?
7)How did this empire end?

7>It's not entirely clear, but it seems that they were abruptly wiped out in some great cataclysm.
Was it war? A cosmic impact? Disease?
It seems likely, to me, that they were unable to adapt to the ending of the ice age.
5)What artifacts do you have here?

8>This book is the oldest magical tome I've ever been able to find.
It seems to regard certain advanced techniques in teleportation.
Legend suggests it "holds the keys to space and time."
