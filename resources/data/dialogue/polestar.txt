0>Who has come to visit us?
Oh, it's you, $cosmicName. 
1)I just stopped in to say hi.
2)I have some questions for you.
9)Do your buddies talk?

1>Well met, friend.
END

2>I am a simple man.
3)Do you know how to kill a vampire?
5)Do you know how to cross the volcano?
4)Do you know how to survive on the moon?

3>Vampires are ethereal, like ghosts. Normal weapons cannot hurt them.
You need a cosmic weapon.
6)Where can I get a cosmic weapon?
1)Thank you, no more questions.
2)I have more questions.

4>You can't breathe on the moon.
Therefore, the only creatures that can survive on the moon are those that do not need to breathe.
7)What sort of creature doesn't need to breathe?
1)Thank you, no more questions.
2)I have more questions.

5>Volcanos are pretty hot, I bet. You'd need to be immune to fire.
Do you know anyone like that?
1)I have to think about it. Thank you.
2)Not sure. I have more questions.

6>What do I look like, an arms dealer?
Anything made of silver is a safe bet. Rare and powerful weapons, that sort of thing.
1)Thank you, no more questions.
2)I have more questions.

7>I don't know. Nothing natural, that's for sure. The undead, maybe.
1)Thank you, no more questions.
2)I have more questions.
8)How do I become undead?

8>It is said that eating a vampire's heart is a sure way to take on the curse of the undead.
Or maybe the potion seller could tell you how to make a potion of undead.
What a terrible idea! Don't do it!
1)Thank you, no more questions.
2)I have more questions.

9>They have taken a vow of silence.
1)I just stopped in to say hi.
