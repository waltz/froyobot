0>Hello. I am Satan.
1)Are you the guy from that statue of the demon wrestling a giant snake?
2)So you're the king of this city?

1>My dear [[man|woman]], nobody knows this but I have the soul of an artist!
This throne, this city.... The fife-player.... I would give it all in an instant!
And that statue is based on the time I wrestled the snake from "Anaconda."
3)An artist? You?
4)Well, why don't you give it up then?

2>Oh! This horrid city! 
These vast halls of wealth and power I command! The shrill tune of the fife-player! It is a prison!
Believe me when I tell you, my dear [[man|woman]], it is a prison and no mistake!!
These riches do not satisfy my inner soul, the soul of an artist!
4)If you hate it so much, why do you live this way?
3)Have you tried the smoothie shack?

3>In truth, I long for the wild and carefree life of the bohemian...
But could I ever escape my legacy, my family? This prison? No! 
O! The life of a yogurt commercial actor! A life of adventure! Thrills! Oh, to be that wild and carefree!
5)Let me tell ya, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

4>Oh, I could never actually leave it all behind, you realize. 
Though I would be happy to live in a squalid apartment, drinking "alcoholic seltzers" and sleeping in a bathtub, I am bound too tight by these golden chains.
Greatness, and great potential: I am accursed of these.
I truly envy the carefree life of, for example, the humble yogurt commercial actor.
5)Let me tell ya, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

5>Oh! You are a yogurt commercial actor? You?
You? Really?
...
Are we in a yogurt commercial right now?
6)That's what I'm here to do. Let's grab my camera and get down to business. Yogurt business.

6>END
