The revelation of the three secrets will unveil the true meaning of the visitation and of the yogurt commercials.
Now, where did we leave off?
1)I need you to stop making wormholes in my livingroom or whatever it is that you're doing.
1)Amazing! Just like in my comic books!

1>How do you feel about the yogurt business?
3)Yogurt is my ticket to incredible riches!!!
3)I really need this job to work out but the guys running the operation are real jerks!
4)You drag me out here to ask me that?

2>Node

3>What wonderful drama, to chase after the elusive success!
There once was this guy who climbed so much he climbed all the way to the top of Mount Everest.
When he got to the top, he saw he was just at the base of an even taller mountain.
He kept doing this forever, like an asshole, because he was actually in the toroidal dimension.
5)Is there a point to all this?
5)I think I remember this episode of the Twilight Zone.

4>No, I am here to reveal the third secret!
6)Let's get on with it.

5>Ha ha ha ha ha!
Are you ready for the third secret?
6)Hit me.

THE THIRD SECRET!
TEXTSIZE:NORMAL
You will have to make a choice!
But at the time, you may not think you have any choice.
If you can find the obscure path, you will liberate us all from this cosmic cycle.
7)How am I supposed to make the right choice when I don't know that I'm choosing?
8)What cosmic cycle?

7>Take all the time you need. You want to ride around again on the cycles of rebirth? Go for it.
As long as you are attached to this world it will exist for all these beings.
That is all for now. You must now return from non-ordinary reality.

8>An 8D holographic brane achieved singularity inversion in the year 2037 when it collided with a yogurt factory.
Since then, we've been trying to wake up.
That is all for now. You must now return from non-ordinary reality.
