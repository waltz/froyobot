0>Hello, $eitherName! Enjoying the afterlife?
1)This isn't much of an afterlife.
2)I think I'm done here, I'd like to go back now.

1>Oh, and I suppose you think regular life was a real how-do-you-do then?
I'm sorry that our metaphysical plane of existence isn't up to your standards!
If you have any complaints, I suggest you take it up with Orobas!
END

2>Oh sure, right, of course. Let's see...
If you wait here, the next bus should come by in two millenia!!!
Har har har har!!!
END
