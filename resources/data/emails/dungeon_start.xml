    Hi $name,

    I heard from my pickleball partner that there's a vampire dungeon out there. My mind immediately went to: dungeon, vampire, sexy, yogurt, yogurt commercial?

    Could you shoot a commercial in the vampire dungeon? We are uniquely positioned to corner the vampire yogurt market this quarter.

    I know, it's not the studio you're used to... You'll have to figure out how to smuggle the camcorder down there. Don't worry, I have full confidence in your abilities. Here at EB Productions we believe in empowering our employees to find bold solutions to hard problems.

- Howard, CEO, Bob Yogurt
