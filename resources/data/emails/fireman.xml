  Hi $name,

    I'm confused, why did the fireman have three heads? Why did the fireman have golden scales and bat wings, and why was the commercial set in Japan, with all that violence?

    Oh, I'm sorry. Reviewing my notes now, it seems I was watching a Godzilla movie.

    Unfortunately, the footage you sent us has been lost, but we appreciate your effort and hard work.
