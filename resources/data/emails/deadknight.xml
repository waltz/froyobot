    Hi $name,

    Absolute bang-up job, taking on the knight like that. You laid him out like a sack of wet trash. He crawled sobbing in the gutter, like the cur he is.

    By the way, did you think to grab his armor while he was down? Some say there is no honor in robbing dead men, but to them I say: you sneaking cowards can come try and take it from me, you gutless swine!

    The Mayor

    PS- Have you seen what's on the other side of the lava flow, yet? If you can find some way to become fireproof, try checking it out.
