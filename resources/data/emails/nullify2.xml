    Hi $name,

Loved the commercial. "Nullify Hatred," great, just great stuff. Really makes you think, right? 

I think we need a little more though. Can we do it again, but this time we can nullify an effigy of ignorance too. That would be a good move, from a PR standpoint, since ignorance is considered pretty bad these days.

- Howard, CEO, Bob Yogurt

PS - I accidentally sent my order from the Sharper Image catalog to your home address. Just keep it, I need to make some phone calls.
