  Hi $name,

  Great commercial! Loved the hustle, [[little man|little lady]]! Oh yeah!
  
  Unfortunately we can't use this commercial. It really sucked, execs didn't like it.

  Look, we just want to make a few little changes, then the commercial will be good to go! It's really almost there. Go to the studio to see our new ideas, I think you'll love them!
  
  We like to give our top talent something to show our appreciation. Check outside your front door for the package.

    -Susan
