    Hi $name,

    I really love that vampire dungeon. What a great look! It really works with the yogurt we are trying to sell.

    Just kidding. The commercial sucked! Back to the drawing board!

    Sorry you had to go through the dungeon, we've sent you something to hopefully make up for all that. Thanks.

- Howard, CEO, Bob Yogurt
