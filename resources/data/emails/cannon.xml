    Hi $name,

    Let's get to the point, quick. I want you to put gunpowder in that cannon, climb inside, and set it off.

    Why? Because I believe it will shoot you all the way to the moon.

    Think about it. How bad could it be? You'll just need to get some gunpowder- try asking around for that. The guy who watches the cannon might know something.

    The Mayor
