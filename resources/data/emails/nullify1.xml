    Hi $name,

Our public image sucks! That’s the problem!

PR dept. has provided me with a list of Bad things Bob Yogurt has done: 

    * funded a paramilitary mercenary group 
    * embroiled in international diplomatic incident, sanctioned by the UN
    * social media team posted “lol @ humanitarian crises” on the official social media account

In short, $name, it's not good. We need to shore up our image, and we think you can help. 

We’ve got a giant effigy labeled “hate”, we’d like you to annihilate it with the cosmic nullifier as part of a commercial. 

The PR team assures me this will make a powerful statement and it might even go viral.

- Howard, CEO, Bob Yogurt
