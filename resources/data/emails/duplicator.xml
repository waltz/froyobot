  Hi $name,
  
  You need to eat ten eggplants on camera. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.

  The prop master couldn't find ten eggplants, so we've ordered an Acme Duplicator 3000â„¢ to be shipped to your home.

  Use it to duplicate your eggplant.

  Producer, EB Productions, Inc.

  PS: Under no circumstances should you use the duplicator on anything other than eggplants.

  EB Productions, Inc., will not be held liable for damages, public or private, that occur as a result of misuse of duplicator.

  The end user accepts all responsibility for felonies, crimes, or misdemeanors incurred as a result of use of duplicator.
