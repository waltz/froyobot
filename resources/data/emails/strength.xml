    Hi $name,

    I won't beat about the bush. We need your help, $name.

    Apparently some knight has set up on the bridge in the woods. He's been harassing people and claims to be "defending the bridge". He's gotta go.

    You should be able to fight him with that strength potion you have. Drink some of the strength potion and then go rough him up a little, how about.

    You could be like a superhero. "Strong [[Man|Woman]] That Kicks Knights' Asses". It would look good on a resume!

    The Mayor
