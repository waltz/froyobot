    Hi $name,

    How did you get the mayor to agree to be on camera? He never shows his face except at formal occasions and ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Some believe the mayor to be a myth.

    Needless to say, we are astounded by your willigness to go the extra mile for these yogurt commercials. Although we cannot use the commercial, please accept our gift as a token of our appreciation and desire to continue working with you.

  -Susan
